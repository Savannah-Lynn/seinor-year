	<p>After you graduate high schoool, what are you going to do?  Are you going to go straight to work?  Are you going to take a gap year?  Or are you going to go straight back to school?  These are all things that all high school seinors think about.  No matter what you do, you need to fill out an application.  It doesn't matter if it is a college application or a job application, you still need to do it.</p>	
	<p>With a job, I would go on websites to search for jobs that interest you and you are qualified for.  If you are qualified, it will increase the likely hood of you getting the job.  For school, I recommend taking tours of prospective colleges and then decide and apply.  Make sure it has the right majors for you, interests, tuition is good, etc.</p>
